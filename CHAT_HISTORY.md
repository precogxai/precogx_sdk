## Troubleshooting test_agent.py and Telemetry Ingestion

After getting the basic frontend dashboard working, the next step was to ensure the `test_agent.py` script could successfully send telemetry to the backend.

We encountered several issues during this process:

1.  **`ModuleNotFoundError: precogx_sdk`**: The `precogx_sdk` package was not installed in the dummy agent's environment. **Fix:** Installed the SDK in editable mode (`pip install -e .`) from the SDK directory.

2.  **`422 Unprocessable Entity` (initial)**: The backend rejected the telemetry payload. We added debug logging in the SDK emitter to inspect the payload and backend response.
    *   **Issue:** Schema mismatch - The backend expected `prompt` and `metadata`, but the SDK sent `input` and `interaction_metadata`.
    *   **Fix:** Updated the `InteractionEvent` schema (`precogx_sdk/precogx_sdk/schemas.py`) and the callback handler (`precogx_sdk/precogx_sdk/precogx_langchain/callback_handler.py`) to use `prompt` and `metadata`.
    *   **Issue:** Missing `X-API-Key` header - The backend explicitly required the header, but the SDK's `httpx.post` call was not including the `headers` dictionary.
    *   **Fix:** Added `headers=headers` argument to the `httpx.post` call in `precogx_sdk/precogx_sdk/emitter.py`. Reinstalled the SDK after changes.

3.  **`500 Internal Server Error`**: After fixing the 422 errors, the backend returned a 500 error.
    *   **Diagnosis:** Checked backend Docker logs (`docker logs -f docker-api-1`).
    *   **Issue:** `sqlalchemy.exc.ProgrammingError: (psycopg2.errors.UndefinedTable) relation "agents" does not exist` - The database table for the `Agent` model was missing.
    *   **Fix:** Temporarily added `Base.metadata.drop_all(bind=engine)` before `Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine)` in `precogx_product/app/main.py`. Restarted Docker containers (`docker-compose restart`) to recreate tables. Immediately removed the `drop_all` line.
    *   **Issue:** `AttributeError: 'Interaction' object has no attribute 'prompt'` - The backend code (`precogx_product/app/api/endpoints/telemetry.py`) was trying to access `i.prompt` for historical interactions, but the ORM model field is named `input`.
    *   **Fix:** Changed `i.prompt` to `i.input` in the relevant line in `ingest_telemetry`.

After these fixes, the `test_agent.py` successfully sent telemetry, and the backend processed it with a `200 OK` status, confirming the end-to-end flow is working.
